Welcome to my repository for my Embedded Systems Senior Design Porject. This
project utilizes the Raspberry Pi 2b+ as the main hardware and Python as the
main programming language. I built a portable and merciful pest control device 
that is used for catching pests asthey wander into it. It can notify the user 
via text and email when it has captured something as well as takes a picture 
and sends that as well. The user can also use a live feed by using a camera app 
for the Raspberry Pi. For more info, feel free to read the write-up in my
repository.
